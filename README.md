# PersonalSite
Source code for my personal site, using a Flask backend and vanilla HTML, CSS and JS frontend
## I'm currently self-hosting at [http://thetridentguy.xyz](http://thetridentguy.xyz)
- HTTP-only until I set up certs
- If it's down, bear with me, and skip on voting for this matchup (unless of course, it's obvious that my site is better)
## Site Features:
- Several Pages, including an about me, and projects page
- Dynamic theme: change the color theme of the site by changing the color pickers in the top right corner of the site, changes persist via `localStorage`.
